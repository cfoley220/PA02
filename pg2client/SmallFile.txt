Social Sensing and Cyber-Physical Systems

Note: this course will be offered in Spring 2016, keep your eye on the registration dates :)


Description: 
Just as Internet changed the way people interact with each other, social sensing and cyber-physical systems (CPS) are changing the way people interact with the world! Social sensing and CPS integrate sensing, computation, control and networking into physical objects and infrastructure, connecting them to the Internet and to each other. This course offers students the opportunity to learn the theoretical foundations, state-of-the-art techniques, emerging applications, and hands-on experience in this emerging area.   The advances in such an area hold the potential to reshape our world with more responsive, precise, reliable and efficient systems, enabling a revolution of  “smart” devices and systems – from smart cars to smart grids collectively giving rise to smart cities – that can address some of our most pressing national priorities (e.g., health, energy, science & technology, security, etc.) 

Some sample topics that will be covered include:
-	Big Data Processing Paradigm (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop)
-	Fighting Information Overload in Online Social Media Sensing (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
-	Data Reliability and Information Trustworthiness Issues
-	Mobile and Crowdsensing (e.g., smartphone-based sensing)
-	Automotive Sensing and Intelligent Transportation (e.g., green navigation)
-	Wearable Sensing and Body-Area Sensor Networks
-	Medical Sensing and Applications
-	Energy Issues (e.g., smart grid and zero-energy buildings) and Privacy Issues
